				<h1 class="heading1">The Keycaps</h1>

				<p>There are so many options out there in different profiles, designs, and materials. Here's is what you should look at when choosing the keycaps:</p>

				<p><strong>Material:</strong> Keycaps usually come in ABS or PBT plastic. PBT is usually considered higher-end because they are more durable. When looking at the really end keycaps, however, <strong>ABS is preferred as there are less imperfections</strong>.</p>

				<p><strong>Profile:</strong> The profile refers to the overall shape of the keycaps. There are two main types, <strong>uniform and sculpted</strong>. Uniform are all the same height while sculpted come in different angles. Sculpted makes it so you don't need to stretch your fingers as far when typing. <em>The best profile is Cherry profile</em></p>
