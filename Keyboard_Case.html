				<h1 class="heading1">The Case</h1>

				<p>The case is an essential component that holds everything together and protects it from the elements. You get to choose between a ton of different <strong>materials</strong> and mounting types depending on what you're looking for. It's all about choosing the case that fits your setup the best.</p>

				<p><strong>Plastic cases:</strong> The most common being the easiest to manufacture and the cheapest to produce. Plastic cases are usually made from an ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) plastic and come with a metal plate to support the structure of the case. <em>A plastic case is perfect for those on a budget or who prefer a keyboard that is lighter and easier to take on the go.</em></p>

				<p><strong>Aluminum cases:</strong> Aluminum cases tend to be heavier and sturdier. They are an excellent option for someone who needs a super solid case. Aluminum cases are more inflexible and rigid than plastic. The quality of the case ranges depending on the grade of aluminum and how precisely the cases were manufactured when built. <em>These are a great option if you're willing to pay a little more than plastic and want a heavy and solid keyboard.</em></p>

				<p><strong>Acrylic cases:</strong> Acrylic cases are super interesting, they are made from a plastic that has the material properties of glass. They are super light and let the lighting effects shine through the case. Acrylic cases are perfect for someone who enjoys a lightshow every time they turn their keyboard on, <em>but keep in mind, they tend to more fragile and flexible than other material types.</em></p>
